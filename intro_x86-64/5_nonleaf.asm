uint2str:
    ; The two instructions below appear at the beginning of nearly all
    ; non-leaf functions. These are often called the prologue of a function.
    ;
    ; When a function returns, some of the registers must have the same
    ; value they had when the function was called. Those are named
    ; "callee-saved registers". Which registers are callee-saved is defined
    ; by the OS's ABI.
    ; It doesn't matter whether the function changes these registers during
    ; its execution, but if it does, they must be restored to their original
    ; values. To that end, we must store their original values somewhere
    ; - and that somewhere is also the stack. We store them explicitly with
    ; the PUSH instruction, which explains the 'push rbp' below, because
    ; rbp is one of the callee saved registers.
    ;
    push rbp ; store the previous value of rbp in the stack
    ;
    ; There is one crucial detail we haven't mentioned so far.
    ; We've mentioned the stack - but where is the stack top stored?
    ; It's in a register: rsp (SP meaning Stack Pointer).
    ; In fact, this is what the PUSH instruction does with a 64-bit operand
    ; (from the instruction set):
    ;
    ;"
    ;IF StackAddrSize = 64
    ;THEN
    ;	IF OperandSize = 64
    ;	THEN
    ;		RSP <- RSP - 8;
    ;		Memory[SS:RSP] <- SRC; (* push quadword *)
    ; [...]
    ;"
    ;
    ; Two things are noteworthy in this pseudocode. First, RSP actually has
    ; its value subtracted when something is PUSH'd - meaning that lower
    ; addresses are closer to the stack top, i.e. the stack is
    ; "upside down". (*) Second, the address of RSP is accessed in the
    ; segment register SS, which stands for Stack Segment.
    ;
    ; rsp is also a calee-saved register, so we also have to store its value
    ; somewhere to restore it later. (Actually, this is not always needed,
    ; but we usually store rsp anyway.)
    ; Unlike eip, rsp is not a special register: it's a general purpose one.
    ; It can therefore be used with all instructions that accept
    ; general purpose registers as arguments, including MOV.

    ; Instead of pushing rsp to the stack, we store its value on rbp.
    ; (BP stands for Base Pointer.) We can do this because we've already
    ; stored the previous value of rbp with 'push rbp', above.
    ; We use rbp so we know that all addresses in the range of those
    ; stored by rbp + 8 and rsp are addresses belonging to this function's
    ; portion of the stack (rbp + 8 because of the PUSH above).
    ; That portion is called stack frame.
    ;
    mov rbp, rsp ; store the current stack top at rbp

    ; push the remaining callee saved registers to the stack, so we can
    ; restore them before returning.
    ; (Note that all of those PUSH instructions will change rsp's value.)
    ;
    ; Note: we can keep callee-saved registers unaltered by simply not
    ; changing them. That's why we didn't need these PUSH instructions
    ; in leaf functions: you only need to push the callee-saved registers
    ; you'll change, so in leaf functions there's a good reason not to use
    ; these registers, and no good reason to do so.
    ; However, a non-leaf function calls another function, and we want to
    ; make sure our local variables are not changed in the function we'll
    ; call. To that end, we can either store those variables
    ;
    ;	(1) in the stack, or
    ;	(2) in callee-saved registers.
    ;
    ; We've chosen (2), because accessing stuff from registers is quicker
    ; than from memory; though if we had too many variables to store,
    ; we'd have to resort to (1). This is a decision the compiler does
    ; for you when using high level languages. (*)

    ; Store the arguments passed to us in callee-saved registers.
    ; As per the SysV calling convention, these arguments will be in rdi,
    ; rsi and rdx respectively.
    ;
    ; (Note that, since we're writing both this function and all the ones
    ; that call it, we could have deviated from the calling convention
    ; if we wanted to - as long as both the caller and the callee agree
    ; on where the arguments should be, it really doesn't matter.
    ; But there will be times when our code needs to call functions written
    ; by someone else; then, the easiest way to make these our caller agree
    ; with their callee is to stick to the calling convention.)

; Exercises
;
; === St Thomas' Wisdom ===
; Verify all claims marked with (*).
;
; === Changing Stuff and Seeing What Happens ===
;	- Comment out the prologue and epilogue of both non-leaf functions
;	shown. Do the functions still work? Think about it and explain it
;	to yourself.
;
;	- Do the same for all PUSH instructions with callee-saved registers
;	(after the prologue), on both non-leaf functions.
;
; === Learn to Love Your Compiler ===
; Write the following pseudocode in your favorite *compiled* language:
;
;	(* this function's code could be anything, we just make it complicated
;	 * hoping it won't be inlined.
;	 * If this is still being inlined: usually, there are compiler-specific
;	 * attributes you can put on your code to prevent it from doing so. *)
;	function foo(integer x) -> integer
;		n <- 0
;		i <- 0
;		while (i < x)
;			n += i
;			i += 1
;		end while
;		return n
;	end function
;
;	function bar(integer x) -> integer
;		y <- foo(x)
;		return x * y
;	end function
;
; Now inspect the program generated with "objdump -d". Do you see any PUSH
; instructions in the function foo at all? If you do, try a more agressive
; optimization level. If you don't, that's because the compiler figured that
; foo is a leaf function and thus PUSHing it argument isn't necessary, whereas
; that's not the case for bar. (Its argument is being passed to another function
; and thus needs to be placed in the stack or in a callee-saved register.)
;
; That is the *leaf function optimization*.
;
; === Your turn ===
;	- We've shown a function that converts an unsigned int to string.
;	Write a function that does the opposite: given a string that represents
;	a number and the string size, return the corresponding number.
;	If the function recieves a string that does not represent an unsigned
;	integer, it should print an error message.
;	A string that starts with a number but then derails, like "123abc",
;	may or may not be seen as invalid input: that's up to you.
;
;	- Write a program that reads a string from stdin, turns it into a number
;	with your function, multiplies it by two, turns the result into a string
;	with uint2str, and finally prints that string.
;
;	- Write a recursive function that recieves an unsigned integer N
;	and returns the N-th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
;	Again, bonus points if you use dynamic programming.
;
;	- Write a program to test your Fibonacci function, by calling it with
;	several numbers and printing the return values (again using uint2str).
