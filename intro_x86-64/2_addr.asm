    ; we want to print str several times after making changes
    ; to some of its bytes, to make sure the code works.
    ;
    mov rdx, strsiz
    ; copy the address of str to rsi. mov "doesn't know" it's an address
    ; because the addressing mode wasn't used.
    ;
    mov rsi, str
    mov rdi, STDOUT
    mov rax, 1	; __NR_write

    ; rdx, rsi, and rdi will not be changed through most of this code,
    ; becuase we'll make a lot of syscalls using these same arguments,
    ; so we might as well not touch these registers.
    ; (syscalls do not change the contents of general purpose registers,
    ; except for rcx, r11 and rax).
    ;
    syscall

    ; In Intel syntax, the addressing mode is denoted by
    ; square brackets []. For example,
    ;	mov [rsi], 3
    ; This would be equivalent, in C, to
    ;	*rsi = 3;
    ; (assuming rsi were a variable you could use in C).
    ; This means we write 3 to the address whose value is in rsi,
    ; as if we were dereferencing a pointer. Needless to say,
    ; if the address is not valid, you'll get a segmentation fault.
    ;
    ; There's a problem with this, though. How many bytes do we want
    ; to write? (Keep in mind that, though rsi is 8 bytes, that's the
    ; size of the address, not the operand.)
    ; In C, we never have to ask that question, because C has types,
    ; and each type has a size in bytes. For instance:
    ;	int *x;
    ;	x = /* some valid address */
    ;	*x = 3;
    ; Here the answer to our question is obvious: the assignment writes
    ; sizeof(int) bytes. However, there's no such thing as types
    ; in assembly, so we must write the operand's size explicitly, say
    ;	mov byte [rsi], 3
    ; we could also use 'word' for 2 bytes and 'dword' (double word)
    ; for 4 bytes.
    ; (as a side note: intel syntax generally requires one to write
    ;	mov byte ptr [rsi], 3
    ; the 'ptr' is to make it explicit it's an address, but that's
    ; redundant since we're using the addressing mode anyway!
    ; So nasm decided to remove the 'ptr' keyword altogether.)
    ;

    mov byte [rsi], 'a'
    ; syscalls use rax as return register, so we need to restore
    ; rax to __NR_write = 1 every time.
    mov rax, 1
    syscall

    mov word [rsi], 'bc'
    mov rax, 1

    ; So far we've simply accessed the address at one register,
    ; but you can make arithmetic in the addressing mode; that's
    ; the main reason why this mode is useful.
    ; From the basic architecture manual:
    ; "In 64-bit mode, a memory operand can be referenced by
    ; a segment selector and an offset. [...]
    ; The offset part of a memory address in 64-bit mode can be
    ; specified directly as a static value or through an address
    ; computation made up of one or more of the following components:
    ;	Displacement -- An 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit value.
    ;	Base -- The value in a 64-bit general-purpose register.
    ;	Index -- The value in a 64-bit general-purpose register.
    ;	Scale factor -- A value of 2, 4, or 8 that is multiplied
    ;	by the index value."
    ; In intel syntax, this is written as:
    ;	[base + scale * index + displacement]
    ; (most of these are optional; see below).
    ;
    mov byte [rsi], 'h'		; base only

    mov rax, 1
    syscall

    mov byte [str], 'i'		; displacement only (constant)
    ; displacement only
    ; (constant as well; will be computed when assembling)
    mov byte [str+1], 'j'

    syscall

    mov rbx, 3
    mov byte [rsi+2], 'k'		; base and displacement
    mov byte [rsi+rbx], 'l'		; base and index
    mov byte [rsi+2*rbx], 'm'	; base, scale and index
    mov byte [rsi+2*rbx+2], 'n'	; base, scale, index and displacement

    mov rax, 1
    syscall

    ; We know that
    ;	mov rax, [addr_expr]
    ; would be equivalent, in C, to
    ;	rax = *(addr_expr);
    ; meaning it copies whatever is in the address addr to rax.
    ; But what if we needed to use the artihemtic provided by the
    ; addressing mode, but copy the address itself, instead of its
    ; contents? That's when we use the lea (load effective address):
    ;	lea rax, [addr_expr]
    ; would be equivalent to
    ;	rax = (addr_expr);
    ;
    mov rbx, 2
    lea rsi, [str+2*rbx]	; str+4

    ; because of the arithmetic possible in the addressing mode,
    ; lea is sometimes used with expressions
    ; which aren't addresses at all. For instance, we know that
    ;	lea rcx, [rax + 2 * rbx + 8]
    ; will load rcx with rax + 2 * rbx + 8. Whether this is a
    ; valid address or not doesn't change anything: unlike mov,
    ; lea never tries to access that location.
    ; It wouldn't be possible to do such calculation in a single
    ; instruction without using lea. That's not its original purpose,
    ; but hey, it works!
    ;

; Exercises
;
; === Your Turn ===
;	- Write a program that reads a string from stdin, changes the character
;	in the middle of that string to a newline, then prints it again.
;	(The "middle" can be obtained halving the string's size, which is
;	returned by the read sysem call.)
;
;	- Use the addressing mode to calculate 3*n + 1, where n is the value of
;	a register of your choice.
