; (7) float.asm: floating point numbers, x87/SSE/AVX, byte alignment
;
; We could've explained this sooner, but I wanted to be able to use printf()
; and scanf() rather than making float <-> string conversions by hand.
;
; Note: in this file, we use "float" and "double" as synonyms with
; "single-precision floating point number" (4 bytes) and
; "double-precision floating point number" (8 bytes) respectively.

    ; A few notes on align:
    ; "Both macros require their first argument to be a power of two [...]
    ; ALIGN and ALIGNB, being simple macros, perform no error checking:
    ; they cannot warn you if their first argument fails to be a power of
    ; two [...]
    ; A final caveat: ALIGN and ALIGNB work relative to the beginning of
    ; the section, not the beginning of the address space in the final
    ; executable. Aligning to a 16−byte boundary when the section you’re in
    ; is only guaranteed to be aligned to a 4−byte boundary, for example,
    ; is a waste of effort." (NASM manual, section 4.11.12)

    ; SSE instructions deal with the XMM registers: xmm0 through xmm7
    ; in 32-bit mode, and additionally xmm8 through xmm15 in 64-bit mode.
    ; XMM registers are 128-bit (16-byte) long.
    ; (Basic architecture, sections 10.2.1 and 10.2.2)

    push rbp
    mov rbp, rsp

    ; Align rsp's address to a 16-byte alignment. The reason for this
    ; is the same as for the use of those align macros back there: we want
    ; to use rsp indexed addresses as arguments for SSE instructions,
    ; and those must be 16-byte aligned.
    ;
    ; But how does that align rsp to a 16-byte boundary?
    ; An address that's aligned to a (2^N)-byte boundary is one whose
    ; value is divisible by 2^N.
    ; It turns out, because of how two's complement work, that -2^N is
    ; a value with al bits 1, except for the last N bits, which are all 0.
    ; For instance, with -16:
    ;
    ; 16 = 0..010000 --(1's compl)--> 1..101111 --(+1)--> 1..110000 = -16
    ;
    ; So we could've written the instruction below as "AND rsp, 0xff..f0",
    ; with 31 Fs. We didn't, because if you leave a single F out,
    ; it'd be equivalent to "AND rsp, 0x0f..f0" and no good can possibly
    ; come out of that. Besides, though it may seem weird at first,
    ; the intention is very clear when you write an AND with a negative
    ; power of two like that.
    ;
    ; Therefore, the AND below is zero'ing out the last 4 bits of rsp,
    ; which makes it divisible by 2^4, because that's how the positional
    ; system work: if the N last digits of a number written in base B
    ; are all 0, then the number is divisible by B^N. (The proof is trivial
    ; - yes, I know everyone says that, but for real this time.)
    ; Since we're talking about the last 4 bits being zero, N=4 and B=2.
    ;
    ; (As a side note: sometimes you can omit the prologue and epliogue
    ; of non-leaf functions if you're careful enough.
    ; We can save ourselves from storing rsp in rbp if we can undo all
    ; changes to rsp's value throughout the function.
    ; For instance, if rsp is only manipulated through PUSH and SUB
    ; instructions, we can ADD the same value that was SUB'd and have the
    ; same number of POP instructions than PUSH ones, and that's enough to
    ; restore rsp to its original value. Here, though, this AND cannot be
    ; easily reverted, so it forces us to store the previous value of rsp
    ; somewhere.)

    ; (16 bytes), we can fit 2 doubles or 4 floats in one of them.
    ; When doing so, we say the numbers are packed. However, we can also
    ; store just one float or double per register: when doing so, we say

; Exercises
;
; === Changing Stuff and Seeing What Happens ===
; - Comment out all align macros (only one at a time).
;
; - Comment out all AND rsp, ... instructions. (It may be that you don't get a
; segfault because rsp's address was already on a 2^N-byte alignment by chance.
; If this is the case, throw in a "SUB rsp, 8" so it won't happen.)
;
; - Comment out the CVT* instructions.
;
; === Your Turn ===
; - Write a program that prints the number 0.2 as a float, double, and
; long double, using the same number of decimal places for all of them so you
; can compare the rounding errors.
;
; - Write a program that takes in two vectors of 4 doubles and prints the scalar
; product between them. The vectors can be hardcoded in the data section
; or read using scanf().
;
; - Write an avx512 function that does the same operations as avx, but using
; AVX-512 and the ZMM registers, then write a program to test it.
;
; Bonus
;
; Write an interactive RPN calculator which supports at least the 4 basic
; operations. Whether you'll use float, double or long double is up to you.
