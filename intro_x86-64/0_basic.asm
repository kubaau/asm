; (0) basic: basic assembly stuff.
; The program doesn't do anything useful, it just explains the outline
; of assembly code.
;
; Please read (at least) the sections 'System requirements' and
; 'References' of README first.
;

; This is an assembler directive, i.e. an action to be taken when assembling,
; not when executing.
; This tells the assembler to export the '_start' symbol so the
; linker will be able find it later.
;
global _start

; Every program in ELF (Executable and Linking Format, default in Linux)
; has several sections. You can see them with
;       $ objdump -h <path_to_program>
; There are many, but the sections we'll use are
;
;       data: global variables
;	rodata: global constants (read-only data)
;       bss: space reserved at program startup
;       text: CPU instructions (more on that later)
;
; These directives are used to specify their repsective sections.
;
section .data
    ; Anything that's on the beginning of a line and is followed by
    ; a colon ':' is a label. Labels generally store addresses.
    ; here my_arr stores the address of the first byte declared by
    ; the 'db' (declare bytes) directive.
    ; In other words, this would be equivalent to the C code
    ;
    ;	char my_arr[] = {0x12,0x34,0x56,0x78,0x90};
    ;
    ; Note that db writes its arguments to the resulting program,
    ; i.e. an hexdump of the executable would show these bytes. (*)
    ;
    my_arr: db 0x12,0x34,0x56,0x78,0x90

    ; just as there is db, there's also
    ;
    ;	dw: declare word (2 bytes),
    ;	dd: declare doubleword (4 bytes)
    ;	dq: declare quadword (8 bytes)
    ;
    ; ...among others, but these are the ones we'll use most often.
    ; (See the NASM manual, section 3.2.1 for the full list.)
    ;
    ; It's important to note that all those are little-endian,
    ; meaning that the bytes' order gets "reversed": the last byte in the
    ; multi-byte value goes first. (*)
    ;
    little_endian_beef: dw 0xbeef ; becomes 0xef 0xbe, in that order

    ; if we use dw, dd, ..., with less bytes than they expect, the rest
    ; of the bytes get filled with zeroes.
    ;
    filled_with_zero: dw 0x42 ; becomes 0x42 0x00, in that order

    ; becomes 0x76 0x98 0x32 0x54 0xAA 0x00, in that order
    my_arr2: dw 0x9876, 0x5432, 0xAA
    my_arr3: dd 0xdeadbeef, 0xc0ffee ; 0xc0ffee -> 0xee 0xff 0xc0 0x00
    my_arr4: dq 0x0102030405060708, 0x090a0b0c0d0e0f00

    ; the equ directive sets a name to the value of an expression.
    ; Because this is an assembler directive, UNUSED is not written to
    ; the resulting program. This is similar to #define in C.
    ;
    UNUSED: equ 3

section .text
; The _start label has a special meaning: it's the program's entry point,
; i.e. the first instruction to be executed is at this address.
;
_start:
    ; All these are instructions, i.e. operations the CPU knows how
    ; to carry out directly. There's a full list of them in the
    ; instruction set, but we'll only use a dozen or so.
    ; Instructions are separated from their operands by whitespace,
    ; and the operands are separated from other with commas, like so:
    ;	<instr> <operand1>, <operand2>, ..., <operand_n>
    ; The following instructions are 'mov', which simply copy data.
    ; In case of such instructions, which have a source and
    ; a destination operand, the Intel syntax (which nasm uses)
    ; dictates the first operand is the destination, and the second is
    ; the source:
    ;	<instr> DEST, SOURCE
    ; Generally, the source and destination operands can be either
    ; an address or a register - a small storage that lives inside
    ; the CPU. The source can also be an immediate value, i.e.
    ; a simple number.
    ;
    mov rax, 0 ; moves the value 0 to regsiter rax

    ; There are several registers avaliable on x86_64. Some serve
    ; specific purposes (e.g. registers for storing floating point
    ; numbers), while others are called "general purpose" registers.
    ; There are 16 of them:
    ;
    ;	rax: accumulator
    ;	rbx: base
    ;	rcx: counter
    ;	rdx: destination
    ;	rsp and rbp: stack pointer and base pointer
    ;	rsi and rdi: source and destination index
    ;	r8 through r15: lack of creativity
    ;
    ; The prefix 'r' in all those mean we want to use all 64 bits
    ; in the registers. For all those, except r8 through r15,
    ; it's possible to access:
    ;	- the lowest 32 bits with 'e' prefix, e.g. eax, ebp
    ;	- the lowest 16 bits without any prefix, e.g. ax, si
    ; Also, for registers rax through rdx, it's possible to access:
    ;	- the lowest byte with the 'l' prefix, replacing the
    ;	trailing 'x', e.g. al
    ;	- the highest byte in the 16 bits with the 'h' prefix, in
    ;	the same way as above, e.g. ah
    ; This is summarized in figure 3-5 of section 3.4.1,
    ; basic architecture.
    ;
    ; (Note: we use 'byte' as a synonym of '8 bits', because it
    ; indeed is in the x86 architecture.)
    ;
    mov eax, 0x12345678 ; copies 4 bytes to eax
    ; still copies 4 bytes to eax: the remaining 2 bytes are filled
    ; with zeroes, i.e. this is the same as
    ;	mov eax, 0x0000abcd
    ; note that this is different from 'mov ax, 0xabcd'
    ; in that the previous instruction would only change the lowest
    ; 2 bytes of the register.
    ;
    mov eax, 0xabcd

    ; copies to the lowset byte: now ax will be 0xab12 (*)
    mov al, 0x12
    ; copies to the highest byte: now ax will be 0x3412 (*)
    mov ah, 0x34

    ; and of course, you can make arithmetic too.

    mov rdi, 10
    mov rsi, 7
    mov rbx, 14

    inc rdi		; INC: increment
    dec rsi		; DEC: decrement

    ; ADD: adds the two operands and stores the result in the destination
    ; one (again, that's the first one, because we're using Intel syntax.)
    ;
    add rdi, rbx	; Equivalent to rdi += rbx

    sub rsi, rbx	; SUB: subtract. Equivalent to rsi -= rbx

    ; Naturally, we also have instructions for multiplying and dividing
    ; integers, but they come with a few catches.
    ;
    ; First, there's two variants for each: MUL and DIV interpret their
    ; operands as unsigned integers, while IMUL and IDIV interpret their
    ; operands as signed integers in two's complement.
    ; (This changes whether or not the operands' most significant bits are
    ; interpreted as sign bits).
    ;
    ; Second, while both multiplication and division need two numbers,
    ; the MUL and DIV instructions take a single operand because they use
    ; fixed registers for the other number.
    ; For example, when a 64-bit operand is used in
    ;
    ;	- MUL, the result is rax * <operand>, and it's a 128-bit value
    ;	stored in rdx:rax - meaning the 64 upper bits are stored in rdx,
    ;	while the 64 lower bits are stored in rax.
    ;
    ;	- DIV, the operand is the divisor and the dividend is rdx:rax,
    ;	meaning it's a 128-bit value whose 64 upper bits are in rdx and
    ;	whose 64 lower bits are in rax. The quotient is a 64-bit value
    ;	stored in rax, and the remainder is also a 64-bit value, stored
    ;	in rdx.
    ;
    mov rax, 7
    mov rdx, 4 ; will be overwritten by MUL
    mov rdi, 3

    mul rdi
    ; here, rax <- 3 * 7 = 21, rdx <- 0 (*)

    mov rax, 22
    mov rdx, 0
    mov rdi, 4
    ;mov rdi, 0

    div rdi
    ; here, rax is floor(22 / 4) = 5, and rdx is 22 mod 4 = 2 (*)

    ; finally, we have bitwise operations too.
    mov rdi, 0x35
    mov rsi, 0x44

    and rdi, rsi	; bitwise AND
    or rdi, rsi	; bitwise OR
    xor rdi, rsi	; bitwise XOR

    shr rsi, 2	; right (logical) bitshift: equivalent to rsi >>= 2 (if rsi was unsigned)
    shl rsi, 3	; left (logical) bitshift: equivalent to rsi <<= 3 (if rsi was unsigned)

    ; Note that there's SAR for arithmetic right shift.
    ; There's also SAL, but it's equivalent to SHL.

    ; the code below is a system call to exit cleanly;
    ; we'll explain it in the next file.
    ;
    mov rax, 60
    xor rdi, rdi
    syscall
    ;syscall

; Exercises
;
; === First Things First ===
; Assemble and link this file into a program, then run it.
; (The program should do nothing other than exit cleanly)
;
; === St Thomas' Wisdom ===
; Verify all claims marked with (*).
;	- Print a hexdump of the program to verify db, dw, etc. work as stated,
;	including the endianess.
;	- Run the program in gdb to verify that the instructions work as stated,
;	stepping through each one and printing the affected registers' value
;	as needed. (Refer to the "Debugging" section of README.md to learn how.)
;
; === Changing Stuff and Seeing What Happens ===
;	- Comment out the syscall instruction and run again.
;	- Change DIV's operand to zero and run again.
